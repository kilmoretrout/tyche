# Tyche

## Overview

Tyche is software that queries a pre-computed CFR table for 6-player No-Limit Texas Holdem and for resolving subgames.  I intend to add other games (Omaha poker) and more features to the software as time goes on.

## Install

### Conda

```
conda create -n "tyche" python=3.11
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
